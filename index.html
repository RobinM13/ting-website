        The following is placeholder text for a piece of writing that will be
        provided by Laila.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ting Chang was born in Taiwan and passed away peacefully in her 61st
        year, after a short, but very unexpected illness, during her residency
        as a scholar, at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton New
        Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ting was pre-deceased by her parents Mr. and Ms. Chang. (first names?)
        She is survived by her dearly loved family: sister Ann Taylor Chang
        (Mike Taylor); niece, Chloe; nephew, Will and uncle, Thomas Tang
        (Rebecca), and her many dearly loved friends.
      </p>
      <p>Ting was an exceptional person! We will miss her.</p>

  abstract = {This presentation examines the competing and sometimes conflicting demands encountered in the study of portraiture and biography. Once revised, the paper will become an article that will make an original contribution to art history in empirical and conceptual ways. Based on research in unpublished archives I have discovered the nature of the relationship between the artist Caillebotte and the sitter Cordier, a previously unsolved mystery variously noted by commentators on the painting. I will further advance the discussion by moving away from Michael Fried's concept of "absorption," a persistent interpretive model even in an exhibition catalogue on Caillebotte in 2016, to examine other questions. In addition to the problems faced by both art historians and artists between portraiture (life imaging) and biography (life writing), I will examine representations of "Frenchness," and Cordier's intellectual and political work in the broader context of French imperialism in East Asia.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the career of Alfred Bruyas (1821-77), an art collector and patron active in Paris and Montpellier in the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Through an examination of his personal correspondence, housed in the Fondation Doucet in Paris, his activities and relationships with artists, critics, dealers and fellow collectors are traced from the late 1840s until his death in 1877. Most important among his collaborators were Alexandre Cabanel, Octave Tassaert, Auguste Glaize, Gustave Courbet, Eugene Delacroix, and the art critic Theophile Silvestre, each of whom is discussed at length. Using unpublished documents from the departmental and municipal archives of Montpellier, as well as catalogues and pamphlets published by Bruyas, his goals, practices, successes and failures are considered. In particular, the relationship with Courbet and their ambiguous yet fruitful association are examined, and special attention is paid to events of 1855, the year of the Exposition universelle and the Pavilion of Realism in Paris. In an exhaustive treatment of contemporary criticism, the largely negative reception of the two major paintings by Courbet in which Bruyas figured, The Meeting and The Painter's Studio, are traced. When Bruyas donated his entire gallery to the Musde Fabre in Montpellier his contribution to the history of art was acknowledged and praised. Subsequent art historical scholarship of the twentieth century, in contrast, has tended to reduce Bruyas to an eccentric collector who made little impact, especially in his association with Courbet. Using his example as a point of departure, the long tradition in France of portraying collectors as dangerous, obsessive stalkers on the margins of society is investigated. The origins of that depiction is traced to Jean de La Bruyere who established the indelible topos of the mad collector in his work, Les Caracteres of 1694 (8th edition). Through the analysis of an extensive number of sources — books, newspapers, novelS and private journals — from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the enduring legacy of La Bruyére in the perception and portrayal of collectors in France is demonstrated. As the nineteenth century progressed, individual collectors emerged to play an increasing role in the assembly and preservation of art. In donating their galleries to the public, moreover, they demonstrated a new and essential contribution to the expansion of national museums. Through five case studies I analyse the evolution of private collecting and its impact on public institutions in nineteenth-century France. Bruyas's outstanding contribution is examined within this larger development. In so doing this thesis attempts to dispel the persistent myth of Bruyas as an eccentric collector of no importance.},

            Ting’s Life was Art. She searched for it; she lived inside it; she
            breathed every colour of it. She was fun, funny, acerbic, down to
            earth with a head right up there with the Masters. In 1985, shortly
            after this picture was taken, while she studied in Montreal, she
            wrote to me: “I spend most of my money on prints and catalogues. You
            should see my room — every wall is plastered with reproductions. I
            didn’t write in this card (Renoir man!) in case you wanted to use
            it.”

            I do not have words to express how sad I feel, how cheated I feel at
            the passing of this brilliant star. There are so many things I have
            not told her yet. So, Ting, it will have to wait a little more. I’ll
            see you on the other side, man.
