        <h2>Obituary</h2>
        <p>
          Ting Chang—beloved sister, aunt, niece, partner, friend, scholar,
          teacher, and lover of the arts—died at 3:42 pm on the 8th of October
          2025, on the campus of the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS), in
          Princeton, New Jersey, USA. Ting drew her last breath peacefully and
          without pain, surrounded by her sister, Ann Taylor-Chang, and her
          friends Roger Rouse, Bertilda Barrett, and Mary Dowden-Guy. Friends
          Laila Abdalla and Amelia Vastola had left her side less than an hour
          earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Ann Taylor-Chang
          and Michael Taylor, her niece and nephew, Chloé Taylor and Will
          Taylor, and her uncle Thomas, cousin Norman, and two
          aunts-by-marriage, Rebecca and Catherine. Ting’s friends are familiar
          with her profound and mutually reciprocated love for Chloé and Will.
          At the hour of her diagnosis, “Auntie Ting,” as she was known by the
          Taylor-Chang household and its neighbourhood in Toronto, wrote, “the
          only times I’ve cried in the last dramatic hours was when I thought
          about the children. I haven’t cried about my health or my future but I
          cry whenever I think about the children.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout her life, Ting demonstrated that same level of devotion to
          her family. Born in Taiwan on the 1st of January 1965, she immigrated
          with her mother, father, and sister to Canada as a child. She spent
          her childhood and teenage years in Toronto where, despite significant
          hardships, she continued safeguarding her sister and parents. In 2024,
          with the help of her uncle Thomas, Ting returned to Taiwan for the
          first time since childhood, a trip she recalled as one of the most
          emotional and consequential of her life. There she rediscovered
          locales to which she had first been introduced more than 50 years
          before by her doting mother, grandparents, and Uncle Sam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting also leaves behind her beloved and loving partner, Venanzio
          Capretta, and a large number of friends, many of whom were on the
          WhatsApp group “Spinal Tapped,” so named by Ting, and a prime example
          of her quick sense of humour and playfulness. These friends are too
          many to list, but she would have singled out those who had played
          integral roles in significantly large portions of her life; in
          alphabetical order, Laila Abdalla, Sylvia Ayres, Mark Burde,
          Frédérique Desbuissons, Robin Michel, Marni (Martha) Pike, Roger
          Rouse, Pamela Weber, and Richard Wrigley.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to having Taiwanese and Canadian citizenship, Ting became
          a British national in 2024. She was a global citizen who had lived in
          Taiwan, Canada, England, France, and the United States, and she spoke
          English, French, and Mandarin proficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting’s passion for intellectual pursuits is known and admired by her
          friends and colleagues. After starting undergraduate degrees first in
          philosophy and political science, and then in economics and
          statistics, she eventually settled on her main love, history of art. A
          Bachelor of Arts from McGill University (Montreal, Canada), Master of
          Arts from the University of Toronto (Toronto, Canada), and doctoral
          degree from the University of Sussex (Brighton, England), led to her
          first position as Assistant Professor of Art History at McGill
          University. She later moved to Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh,
          USA), before settling into her permanent position as Associate
          Professor in Art History at the School of Cultures, Languages, and
          Area Studies at the University of Nottingham (Nottingham, England).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting was the recipient of several prestigious research grants and
          fellowships over the years, including from the Social Sciences and
          Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Getty, the Leverhulme, the
          UCLA Clark Memorial Library, the Yale Center for British Art, and most
          recently, the Institute of Advanced Study. At the IAS, she was a
          Visiting Scholar at the School of Historical Studies, on leave from
          her position at the University of Nottingham. In 2021, Ting also
          became an Elected Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting loved all the arts but devoted her studies mainly to European
          painting. Yet her scholarly expertise and interests were widespread,
          ranging from across Asia to Europe and beyond, and from antiquity
          until the end of the long century. Her many publications cover the
          gamut of these extensive interests while showcasing innovative
          critical conceptions. In addition to her book,
          <a
            href="https://www.routledge.com/Travel-Collecting-and-Museums-of-Asian-Art-in-Nineteenth-Century-Paris/Chang/p/book/9781138249196"
            >Travel, Collecting, and Museums of Asian Art in Nineteenth-Century
            Paris</a
          >, an impressive list of journal articles and numerous professional
          presentations constitute a remarkably rich list of scholarship. This
          publication record, and citations of her work by scholars in the
          field, highlight both an international intellectual citizenship, and a
          particular talent for identifying the imperialist motivations of
          European art and its purveyors and consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, Ting had begun a multi-faceted study of the nexus
          between gameplay, the colonialist endeavour, and education, in such
          material artefacts as European goose games (an early form of board
          games), playing cards, globes, and maps that dated from the late 1600s
          into the 1800s. Her plans for the year-long membership at the IAS were
          to draft the results of this research into a monograph tentatively
          entitled Touching History, Playing Empire, and Making Worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting was also an accomplished and inspirational professor. Students
          responded to her patient but persistent guidance, and they appreciated
          her mentorship to cultivate what she termed “smartitude.” Many have
          thanked her for her investment in them even before they quite
          understood how fortunate they were to have such a teacher. In
          particular, her energy leading groups of students around her beloved
          Paris and its museums transformed them from overwhelmed travellers to
          budding art historians with deepening interpretive skills. As a
          permanent student herself, she remained devoted to Tom Crow, her
          doctoral supervisor, and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting’s co-workers throughout the years always knew her to be generous
          and collegial, supportive of them, their departments, and the academy.
          Ting had also invested many uncompensated hours of labour as a Union
          representative at the University of Nottingham, work that was
          especially demanding during the several long and difficult months of a
          strike. More recently, she had begun advocating for considerations and
          accommodations for colleagues with non-normative or neurodivergent
          needs. In Beeston, her hometown in Nottingham, she belonged to a
          mutually supportive and vibrant community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all aspects of her intellectual and social pursuits, Ting was
          committed to the values of diversity, inclusion, social justice,
          environmental stewardship, and the abolition of racism, war, and
          suffering of all kinds. No denizen of the ivory tower, she also had
          many non-academic loves and hobbies: traveling, cooking and eating,
          offering hospitality, visiting galleries and museums, watching films
          and attending the cinema, making jewellery, gardening, hiking,
          laughing, reading, and practising meditation, self-care, and
          self-betterment. Ting often said that she had never been bored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting was always courageous and spirited, a survivor who had bested
          many challenges until this last “lodger in the brain,” as she referred
          to her cruel disease. Those who knew her always saw her steeliness,
          but in recent years, she had consciously applied herself to growing
          her courage and activism, always with vision, ambition, and intention.
          Yet she remained unfailingly kind, a gentle, generous, and intelligent
          presence in the worlds of many of us left behind. Her qualities
          befitted a practitioner of “Buddhism-lite,” as she liked to describe
          herself. She had “made of herself a light,” and her absence now dims
          what could have been. She is grieved for and deeply mourned by the
          many people who loved her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ting: cherished sister, aunt, niece, partner, “bestie,” friend,
          scholar, teacher, colleague, student, neighbour, community-member, and
          global citizen: you are now, and always will be, sorely missed.

  abstract = {This presentation examines the competing and sometimes conflicting demands encountered in the study of portraiture and biography. Once revised, the paper will become an article that will make an original contribution to art history in empirical and conceptual ways. Based on research in unpublished archives I have discovered the nature of the relationship between the artist Caillebotte and the sitter Cordier, a previously unsolved mystery variously noted by commentators on the painting. I will further advance the discussion by moving away from Michael Fried's concept of "absorption," a persistent interpretive model even in an exhibition catalogue on Caillebotte in 2016, to examine other questions. In addition to the problems faced by both art historians and artists between portraiture (life imaging) and biography (life writing), I will examine representations of "Frenchness," and Cordier's intellectual and political work in the broader context of French imperialism in East Asia.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the career of Alfred Bruyas (1821-77), an art collector and patron active in Paris and Montpellier in the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Through an examination of his personal correspondence, housed in the Fondation Doucet in Paris, his activities and relationships with artists, critics, dealers and fellow collectors are traced from the late 1840s until his death in 1877. Most important among his collaborators were Alexandre Cabanel, Octave Tassaert, Auguste Glaize, Gustave Courbet, Eugene Delacroix, and the art critic Theophile Silvestre, each of whom is discussed at length. Using unpublished documents from the departmental and municipal archives of Montpellier, as well as catalogues and pamphlets published by Bruyas, his goals, practices, successes and failures are considered. In particular, the relationship with Courbet and their ambiguous yet fruitful association are examined, and special attention is paid to events of 1855, the year of the Exposition universelle and the Pavilion of Realism in Paris. In an exhaustive treatment of contemporary criticism, the largely negative reception of the two major paintings by Courbet in which Bruyas figured, The Meeting and The Painter's Studio, are traced. When Bruyas donated his entire gallery to the Musde Fabre in Montpellier his contribution to the history of art was acknowledged and praised. Subsequent art historical scholarship of the twentieth century, in contrast, has tended to reduce Bruyas to an eccentric collector who made little impact, especially in his association with Courbet. Using his example as a point of departure, the long tradition in France of portraying collectors as dangerous, obsessive stalkers on the margins of society is investigated. The origins of that depiction is traced to Jean de La Bruyere who established the indelible topos of the mad collector in his work, Les Caracteres of 1694 (8th edition). Through the analysis of an extensive number of sources — books, newspapers, novelS and private journals — from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the enduring legacy of La Bruyére in the perception and portrayal of collectors in France is demonstrated. As the nineteenth century progressed, individual collectors emerged to play an increasing role in the assembly and preservation of art. In donating their galleries to the public, moreover, they demonstrated a new and essential contribution to the expansion of national museums. Through five case studies I analyse the evolution of private collecting and its impact on public institutions in nineteenth-century France. Bruyas's outstanding contribution is examined within this larger development. In so doing this thesis attempts to dispel the persistent myth of Bruyas as an eccentric collector of no importance.},

            Ting’s Life was Art. She searched for it; she lived inside it; she
            breathed every colour of it. She was fun, funny, acerbic, down to
            earth with a head right up there with the Masters. In 1985, shortly
            after this picture was taken, while she studied in Montreal, she
            wrote to me: “I spend most of my money on prints and catalogues. You
            should see my room — every wall is plastered with reproductions. I
            didn’t write in this card (Renoir man!) in case you wanted to use
            it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not have words to express how sad I feel, how cheated I feel at
            the passing of this brilliant star. There are so many things I have
            not told her yet. So, Ting, it will have to wait a little more. I’ll
            see you on the other side, man.

            I met Ting at Leaside High School in the early 1980’s. We also
            worked together outside of school as Hosts, at the Ontario Science
            Centre. Both environments afforded us a lot of time to get up to all
            kinds of teenage capers; some ridiculous, some genuinely hilarious
            and a couple mildly cringe inducing, as is natural for that age. I
            was fortunate to have been invited by Ting as Editor to work with
            her on our school yearbook, Clan Call. Ting’s incredible sense of
            humour and infectious laugh permeated our ill-conceived advertising
            campaign, the looming deadlines, and various crisis situations
            involving darkroom photography. Working on graphic layouts with Ting
            planted the seed of my future career as a designer and educator, a
            through line I can trace all the way to my coding of this website.
            Throughout her life she was a joyful supporter; always profoundly
            enthusiastic about the things people were doing or learning to do,
            and equally joyful about sharing the achievements of her family,
            friends, and colleagues.

            Ting was an inspiration to me throughout her life. She faced
            challenges head on with fortitude and grace, while never wavering in
            her concern for the well being of others. Whip smart, witty, and
            deeply thoughtful; she beautifully deployed her curious intellect to
            explore scholarship, life experiences, and human relationships, with
            each informing the other. I have been deeply fortunate to learn from
            her and to call her my friend. She continues to be my muse and I am
            grateful for the insightful treasure she gave me every time we
            spoke.

            Here is Ting in her own words, answering some of the questions in
            the Proust Questionnaire, on March 19th, 2025.

            I only met Ting a few times and in those times she touched my life.
            Her warmth, enthusiasm and sense of fun all shone through
            immediately the first time we met, when we were introduced by Ian
            Brookes and Caroline Robinson.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year, Ting invited me to join her at an open air theatrical
            event taking place in The Park area of Nottingham, a place Ting was
            very fond of and where she used to live. We enjoyed a happy
            afternoon watching great theatre under the shade of a huge tree on a
            very hot day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you...for the chance to share my all too few memories of Ting.
            [The] obituary brought me to tears, at all we’ve lost.

          <p>Ting sent the best postcards.</p>
          <p>
            During the two decades of our friendship, they came almost every
            time she took a long trip… and I loved them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I loved seeing what she had to say, of course, but I also loved that
            she kept writing by hand well after almost everyone had turned to
            typing messages on screens. It always felt a bit more personal, a
            bit more caring. And I loved that she kept sending things I could
            touch and move, shuffle and show in different ways. Maybe the seeds
            of her second book were germinating for a long time in her fidelity
            to cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ting being Ting, it was clear that she put a lot of thought into the
            images she chose. Somehow, she kept finding ones that echoed themes
            we’d been discussing or that extended little in-jokes we’d been
            sharing. And as with her pithy written messages, her choices were
            often guided by a wry and impish sense of humor. It was lovely to
            feel recognized and encouraged to chuckle at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which brings me to my fridge… Ting is still responsible for almost
            half the pieces on its doors. They’ve been moved around over the
            years and some, as you can see, have become badly stained and
            warped. But I’ve never wanted to take any of them down.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s been truer than ever in the last fourteen months… even for
            the one on the top right, with its haunting offer to replace broken
            heads. As Ting wrote almost a decade ago with her typical prescience
            and dry humor, “unfortunately, this service is not available for
            human heads like yours and mine”. Amid the sadness, she still makes
            me smile.
          </p>

          <p>
            To end with something lighter, here are a few thoughts about two
            other images involving Ting. Both show her working for the union she
            represented and cared about deeply.
          </p>
          <div class="image-container">

                alt="Photograph of people holding signs reading: On Strike Today with central figure smiling."
                width="500"

                src="assets/Ting-Strike-winter.avif"
                alt="Grainy black and white high school yearbook photo."
                width="500"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            The one on the left, by Lisa Rull, appears at the end of Laila’s
            very moving obituary. It’s been my favorite photo of Ting since I
            first laid eyes on it because it condenses so much of what I loved
            about her: the ability to combine great kindness and concern for
            others with an admirable “steeliness” and willingness to push back,
            her emphasis on doing things collectively (even as she loved being
            alone in an archive), and her wonderful capacity for infectious joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hadn’t seen the image on the right until recently, after it was
            posted by Ting’s good friend, Richard Wrigley (though I don’t know
            if he took it). It’s fuzzy because it’s at least a third-hand photo
            of a photo, which makes me think it was often copied and shared, but
            I like it a lot as well because it summarizes in a slightly
            different way so much of what Ting brought to the world: a
            determination that infused everything she did, her willingness to
            stand up for what she thought was right, not just for herself but
            for others as well, and her ability to keep smiling come what may.
          </p>
          <p>We were lucky to have her in our lives.</p>
